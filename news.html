				<h4 id="4">Annual Institute Charity Pub Quiz</h4>
				<i>(<u>February 26th, 1996</u>) Annual institute charity pub quiz hailed a success.</i>
				
				<p>This past Thursday night, the Beehive public house was the setting for the annual Magnus Institute Quiz.</p>
				<p>In recent years the Quiz has gone from strength to strength, raising money for our community outreach program 'Eye on the Institute'.
				<br/>The defending champions were back on top form: Snazzy Tapir have taken the title for the Human Resources department on seven consecutive occasions, including a flawless victory in 1994. It looked as if they were all set to take the title again with an early lead.</p>
				
				<div id="spoiler4" style="display:none">
However, the combination of some of our finest minds from Artefact Storage proved to be somewhat of a challenge, with the Prickwillow Papers snatching the title in the last moments with their encyclopaedic knowledge of architecture and the prison system. 
<br/>
Recently appointed Head of the Institute Elias Bouchard was on hand to congratulate the valiant heroes on their knowledge of the Institute's founder, and to award the team with a well-earned bottle of champagne and a trophy, donated to the cause by the Fairchild family, long-time donors to the academic research within our fine institution.
<br/><br/>
This year's quiz has raised over a thousand pounds, and that means that we will open our doors to the general public as well as instigate an open learning pathway with local schools and educational facilities in the area.
<br/><br/>
Anyone wishing to volunteer towards the 'Eye on the Institute' program should contact their department head. Any inclusion will count towards their voluntary public service and will be treated as a holiday in lieu.

				<p><i>(<u>December 22nd, 1995</u>)
				<br/>In our weekly spotlight on a case from our Archives, we delve into some of the more bizarre and unusual cases that have happened on the Institute's own doorstep.</i></p>
				
				<p>This week, we look at a report from a popular haunt just two streets away...</p>
				
				<div id="spoiler9" style="display:none" align="justify">
The Quantum Leopard Comedy Club was the sight of a bizarre occurrence, not once but several times in the space of a month. The Club itself is set back from Main Street, and accessible from the courtyard just off Havannah Road. It is unassuming at first glance, a glass window with a solid black door, but behind is a popular nightspot that is frequented by the staff of the nearby office buildings and hosts an open mic night twice a month.
<br/><br/>The Club, based in the basement of an old factory building, accessed by a winding metal staircase, has gained popularity in recent years. Its staircase is now an entry several times in our Archives, having become somewhat of a phenomenon.
<br/><br/>
Statements have shown possible time leaks or extended gaps in people’s memories, where they can not account for where they were or what they did, with some statements suggesting that they had lost up to three hours of their night, having left to visit the toilet and returning after the open mic set had completed for the evening.
<br/>Our Research teams, however, have so far been unable to verify any anomalies upon traversing to the site.
<br/><br/>
One statement giver, who happily declined her identity as Jenny H., said she had been let out of the bar by a tall bouncer with curly blonde hair, only to step on to an impossible staircase that seemed to go on forever.
<br/>When she turned to return to the foot of the stairs, it was unreachable; the man was gone and she could only see the stairway reaching on forever.  
<br/>She went on to say that only after giving up and collapsing on a step in defeat did the door to the bar become visible again. Upon exiting the stairway her friends informed her that it was time to leave. 
<br/><br/>
<i>Jenny’s report is one of several that are available to read and access via our Library staff.</i>
