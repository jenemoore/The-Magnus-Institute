<br/>Subject: <b>Please Consider Replacing Your Vending Machines</b></i>
<br/>---------------</p>

<div class="guestbook">I went there to give a statement (yeah I know, but I couldn't really tell anyone else) and tried to get coffee from one of the vending machines on my way out, but it must have needed replaced because all it did was give me bones (?!) in my plastic cup?! Is that just for the public vending machines?! I don't know what's happening there but I'm not sure that's compliant with food guidelines!! What if it's mice that died in there!!!! Please do something!!!
<br/>Also, that's neither here nor there but I keep having weird dreams about the lady who took my statement. I'm sure it's not her fault and she seems very competent but I already have insomnia and I really didn't need that :/</div>

<div class="guestbook"><b><u>Goals and Objectives</u></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Goal</b>: Basically: Decrease the ratio of lower-quality to goooooooood audio content available. The current situation is an obvious travesty; a direct consequence of every late-twenties man in a vaguely urban area picking up a microphone and pouring his thoughts out into the ether. <i>Anyway</i>: We at Corroded Reed believe that the audience deserves better, and that we can in fact literally ruin listeners for all other ... <strike>should probably cut this bit for length?</strike>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Objective</strong>: Provide listeners with the initial season of our Actual Play series, which will <strike>hook listeners through subliminal manipulation</strike> raise awareness of the issues with audio quality currently available. In real terms: This will create a demand for further quality content. A couple of things that will be baked in as strategies for increased listenership:

<ul>
	<li>“Gaming and Giving”, a fundraiser handled by our Head of Video</li>
	<li>The Unknowing (thwarted)</li>
	<li><strike>we can’t just put “Profit”  here, can we?</strike></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="guestbook"><b><u>Plan of evaluation</u></b>
<br/>Each outreach event will, for various reasons, engage at least 50 community members, and this rate will grow by at least 10 % over the course of Phase One. Linked spreadsheets with underlying data available on request; what it comes down to is this:
<br/>
<img src="images/corrodedgraph1.jpeg" alt="A line graph representing the number of engaged community members over time from 1996 to 2000. It steadily increases over time, going from about 10 community members in 1996 to 350 in 2000." style="max-width:624px;" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rate of paying listeners will increase by approximately ? % by the time of completion of Phase One, as measured by registered donors/monthly listens. Multiple linked spreadsheets available on demand. I’ll give you this graph for free:
<br/>
<img src="images/corrodedgraph2.jpeg" alt="A line graph with two lines. One line represents the projected number of registered patrons from 1996 to 2001. It increases slowly over time, going from 0 in 1996 to roughly 750 in 2001. The other line represents the projected number of monthly downloads. It increases slowly at first, going from 0 in 1996 to 2000 in 1999, at which point it starts increasing faster to reach 6000 in 2001."  style="max-width:624px;" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<br/>
Weekly faffing-around meetings between CEO, Producer, and Head of Video, and daily meetings between CEO and COO, will ensure running evaluation of progress.</div>

<div class="guestbook">Circling back around: We are exceptionally grateful to have the opportunity to apply for a grant from your esteemed institute, and look very much forward to be doing business with you. You may be monsters, but we respect your craft!</div>

<p><i>From <b>Rosalin Gray</b> on <b>08/05/1996 8:51PM</b>
<br/>Subject: <b>Gratitude</b></i>
<br/>---------------</p>

<div class="guestbook">Seeing as I have now reached the end of my thesis work on the psychology of terror, I would like to extend my most heartfelt thanks to your institute for all the support, thought-provoking discussions, and wide range of research material that you have made available to me over the past years. I know mister Wright would hear none of it but truly, I am in your debt for all you have helped me through.</div>

<div class="guestbook">After that bother in Scandinavia halfway through my second draft I genuinely thought all hope was lost; but then there you were, like a godsend (although I’m sure debates could be had regarding which god, of course... you know what I mean, I hope). I could not be more happy with our partnership and who knows, maybe I shall throw my hat in the ring the next time you advertise an open position? There is ever more knowledge to chase, and I believe your institute have a near uncanny way with it. Fear not, though, of course I intend to pad the old CV a bit first, but I doubt you have heard the last of me!</div>

<div class="guestbook">Many thanks again.
<br/>R. Gray
